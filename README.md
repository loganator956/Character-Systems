# Character-Systems

A set of tools and components relating to characters in Unity. Hopefully aiming to be as simple to use as possible.

## Requirements
- Obviously Unity
- Recommended to use Unity's Input System Package (Although not necessarily required)

## Planned Features
- Simple configurable Movement component
- A simple inventory system (?)
- Probably more things
