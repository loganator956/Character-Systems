# Character-Systems

A set of tools and components relating to characters in Unity. Hopefully aiming to be as simple to use as possible.
Currently 3D movement is incomplete. I want to experiment with using various methods (eg: changing velocity, using 
`CharacterController` component, using forces, etc.) to find which works best. 

## Requirements
- Obviously Unity
- Recommended to use Unity's Input System Package (Although not necessarily required)
